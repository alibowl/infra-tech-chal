# DevOps Infrastructure Interview Challenge

## Overview

During a heycar team social event, the DevOps team have hit a wall where they were unable to decide upon what the team’s favourite Pocketmonster is. The team have come up with an app that will display the Pocketmonsters stats and movesets based on name and are looking to present this in the next Engineering Tech Hub, which will help the team in making a definitive decision.

As the DevOps Engineer leading this project the team has asked you to roll out the application to be showcased during the Engineering Tech Hub.

## Task
- Clone the following github repo: https://github.com/hey-car/infra-tech-chal.git
- Write a helm chart to deploy the app on a containerised orchestration either: kubernetes / minikube / kind
- Create a pipeline to build, test and push your container to a repository in an automated fashion (can use any CI CD tool)
- Prepare to demo your challenge to the DevOps team in preparation for the Tech Hub

**Considerations:**
- Any improvements to be made
- Security
- Monitoring
- Resiliency and Production Readiness

## Bonus Task:
- Write IaC using Terraform to host application on AWS EKS
- Deploy application to EKS
